// King hunt.  Nxg7 is good.  Probably other good moves too.

r1b2rk1/p1p1qppp/1pn1p1n1/3pP3/3P4/2PB2P1/PP1N1PP1/R2QK1NR b KQ -
// Beo played h6? in a game.  I suggest this might be a mistake - opening up
// the kingside for attack a few moves later after (wp)g4 and (wp)g5.  Otherwise,
// Beo was unwise to fail to prevent g4,g5 afterwards by leaving Qe7 and Ng6

** "NEVER CONCEPT" TESTS **

8/6p1/7k/7B/6PK/2p2P2/8/8 w - -
// 1. g5+ Kh7; 2. Bf7 c2; 3. Kh5 c1=Q; 4. g6+ Kh8; 5. Kg4  and white draws
7k/5Bp1/6P1/7K/8/5P2/8/2q5 w - -  // Position before Kg4
// Beowulf doesn't recognise the fact that the black pawn is locked, the king is blocked,
// and there is no way black can CM without removing the pawn.  To do this he must lose
// the queen.  Clever ;)

8/8/8/5Bp1/7k/8/4pPKP/8 w - -
// 1. Bg4 !! e1=Q; 2. h3! and white draws
8/8/8/6p1/6Bk/8/5PKP/4q3 w - - // Before h3!
// Similar - black's pawn is blocked and there is no mating situation

k7/rb6/pr4p1/Pp3pPp/1Pp1pP1P/2PpP3/3P4/4K3 w - - 
// Don't capture axb6!  (Drawn position)

// A much easier version


** From Jim's Analysis **
-------------------------

r1b1k2r/ppp1bppp/3qp3/8/2PP4/3QBN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w kq -
// c5? too committal.  Better is Qe4.

8/5bPK/2p5/2Bk4/1P6/5p2/8/8 w - - 
// g8=q is an easy draw.
// Beowulf thinks it's 1.2 pawns ahead.  (3/01/02) Crafty says ~0.2.

r1b1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/4PP2/1NNB4/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq f3
// Bb4?? (e5)  Required is d6 (stopping e5).  KB is vital in Sicilian games.
// Crafty also plays this move.

r2q1rk1/1b1nbpp1/p3p2p/8/Pp1p4/3BPNNP/1P3PP1/2RQ1RK1 w - -
// exd4 is drawish and lifeless
// Nxd4 is better followed by Bb1 or Qc2 (i.e.)

2r2rk1/pp1bbp2/2p4p/n5p1/3P4/4B1P1/P1RNPPBP/2R3K1 w - -
// h4? here opens the h-file and allows an easy black attack

r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/2pq4/8/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -
// We don't like 7. .. c4

4kb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/8/3r4/4BBP1/PP3P1P/R4RK1 b k -
// Rb4 is bad.  Rc6 is better, reinforcing the knight.
// Balance development versus material

r4rk1/ppq1ppbp/3pbnp1/8/3BP3/2N2P2/PPPQ2PP/1K1R1B1R w - -
// Nb5 is a bit dodgy.  g4 is better.

r4rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/1N6/2q1P3/5P2/PPPQ1BPP/1K1R3R w - -
// Nxa7?? is terrible.  Qd3 with equality.
// Qd3 at 35 sec. (3/01/02)

8/1r2kp2/1rn3p1/4p2p/P3R2P/KP3P2/2P1R1P1/8 w - -
// Rxe5!?? is really cool :) Congrats Beo!  Changes to f4 later on though...

5rk1/7p/p2q2p1/4p3/3pQ3/5P2/PPP3P1/3KR3 b - -
// Rf5 is passive.  Rb8 is much better.

1r4k1/3n3p/6p1/8/2p5/2N5/1P4PP/4R2K w - -
// Don't attack the knight.  Rb4 to remove the pawn is better

3b4/p4p1p/P3P2p/5P2/1p6/1N3K1k/5P2/8 b - - 
// f6?  fxe6 is OK.  Lower penalty for doubled pawns in endgame.
3b4/p6p/P3P2p/8/1p6/1N3K1k/5P2/8 b - -
// After the exchange

r1bq1rk1/pp1nppbp/2p3p1/3p4/3PnB2/N1P3P1/PP1N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -
// Capture Nxe4 not Bxe4.  Fianchettoed bishop is strong.

8/8/2n1p1p1/5p1p/Pp1k1P1P/3N2P1/P1K5/8 w - -
// Ne5?? Kd2 - Now toggles between Kd2 and a5.

r2qrnk1/1b2bppp/1pp5/p2p4/3PnB2/PPNNP1P1/4QPBP/R4RK1 w - -
// Na4?? Nxe4  Note bishop on f4, retreat blocked by e3,g3. After Na4, BPg7-g5 wins.
